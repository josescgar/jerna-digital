## The Challenge

Every consulting business needs a portfolio site. But as a technical consultant who helps startups leverage AI, the site itself needed to be the proof of concept. The challenge: build a production-grade, multilingual, accessible portfolio website using **100% AI-agentic development** — no hand-written code, every line generated and committed by AI agents.

This wasn't just about shipping a site. It was about proving that AI agents can handle real software engineering workflows end-to-end: architecture decisions, implementation, testing, design iteration, and deployment.

## AI-First Approach

The entire codebase was built using Claude Code as the primary development agent. Every commit in the repository was authored by an AI agent, guided by human intent and review. The workflow looked like this:

- **Architecture decisions** were made collaboratively — the human provided requirements and constraints, the AI proposed solutions documented as Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- **Implementation** was fully AI-driven — from component scaffolding to styling to test writing
- **Code review** happened through conversation — reviewing diffs, asking for adjustments, iterating on approaches
- **Quality gates** were enforced by pre-commit hooks that the AI itself set up

## Tech Stack

The technology choices were optimized for static-site performance and developer experience:

- **Astro 5** — Islands architecture for near-zero JavaScript by default
- **React** — Only for interactive components (contact form with Framer Motion)
- **Tailwind CSS 4** — Utility-first styling with custom design tokens
- **TypeScript** — Strict mode with `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` enabled
- **Playwright** — End-to-end testing across multiple browsers
- **GitHub Pages** — Static hosting with CI/CD via GitHub Actions

## Development Workflow

The project followed trunk-based development with feature branches:

1. Issues were created with structured templates
2. Each feature branch got its own PR with a clear scope
3. Pre-commit hooks ran lint, format check, typecheck, and build on every commit
4. Pre-push hooks ran E2E tests before any push
5. CI ran a 3-tier testing strategy: draft PRs got lint-only, ready PRs got Chromium E2E, and merges to main got full cross-browser E2E

This workflow ensured that AI-generated code met the same quality bar as human-written code — because the guardrails were baked into the process, not the author.

## Design System Evolution

The design system went through a structured evaluation process:

1. Four distinct visual directions were prototyped
2. A side-by-side comparison was set up for evaluation
3. The "Minimal" variation was selected — dark mode base with green accent (#22c55e), DM Sans headings, clean geometric feel
4. All variation infrastructure was removed after selection, keeping the codebase clean

The final design tokens are defined as CSS custom properties in a single `@theme` block, with light mode overrides via `[data-theme='light']`. The theme system prevents FOUC with an inline script that reads localStorage before first render.

## Internationalization

The site supports English and Spanish with a clean URL structure:

- English at root: `/about`, `/services`, `/portfolio`
- Spanish with prefix: `/es/about`, `/es/services`, `/es/portfolio`

The i18n system is type-safe — a `TranslationStrings` interface ensures all languages have complete translations at compile time. A `Language` enum provides a single source of truth for language codes. Language preference persists in localStorage and is negotiated automatically on first visit via browser language detection.

## Quality & Testing

The testing strategy covers multiple levels:

- **E2E tests** — Navigation, contact form validation, responsive layout, accessibility, SEO meta tags, i18n URL structure, and theme toggle
- **Type checking** — Strict TypeScript catches issues at build time
- **Linting & formatting** — ESLint and Prettier enforce consistency
- **Build validation** — Every commit must produce a successful static build

All of this runs automatically through git hooks and CI, creating a safety net that makes AI-generated code just as reliable as hand-written code.

## Results

- **100% AI-authored code** — Every line of code was generated by AI agents
- **10+ pages** across 2 languages, all statically generated
- **Sub-2s LCP** on production with minimal JavaScript payload
- **Comprehensive E2E coverage** across 4 browsers
- **Type-safe i18n** with compile-time validation of all translation strings
- **Dark/light theme** with zero FOUC

## Key Takeaways

1. **AI agents can own the full development lifecycle** — not just autocomplete, but architecture, implementation, testing, and deployment
2. **Quality comes from process, not authorship** — pre-commit hooks, CI, and type safety work regardless of who (or what) writes the code
3. **Human-AI collaboration works best as intent + review** — the human sets direction and reviews outcomes; the AI handles implementation details
4. **Documentation is a force multiplier** — ADRs and CLAUDE.md gave the AI agent context that made subsequent work faster and more consistent
